# Why Git Money?

Because something's not right in the world. All you need to do is turn on your
television, open your web browser or read a newspaper. The world is bound to the
will of a small few, who make decisions that aim to decide what's best for the
rest of us - and it's not working. So far these decisions have resulted in wars,
bailouts, inflation, and higher taxes. No doubt, there are many other negatives as well.

And this is why a few of us have built Git Money. This is why we've
chosen a different way. But why? Why choose a more difficult path instead of
doing the other things? Why do people try to swim across the English Channel?
Climb Mount Everest? Run towards danger when everyone else is running away? We
choose this mantra and our currency as bitcoin, not because it is easy, but
because it is hard.

We've said it before and we'll say it again - it doesn't matter where you're
from or who you are. We believe in the right to work anywhere on whatever you
want. It doesn't matter your gender, your education, your social or spiritual
beliefs or your skin color.

We are the Bitcoin Legion. Our home is the Earth and we work in the Cloud - you
are welcome to join us.

## What is Git Money?
